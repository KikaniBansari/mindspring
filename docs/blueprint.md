## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Pale mint (#B2DFDB) for calmness.
- Background color: Soft lavender (#F3E5F5), slightly desaturated relative to the pale mint.
- Accent color: Lilac (#E1BEE7) to indicate interactive elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Nunito', a sans-serif font for a breathy, relaxed, consistent feel. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Use glowing orb-swirl icons for key functions.
- Incorporate generous whitespace (60% of the screen) for a minimalistic design. Ensure all components have rounded corners.
- Use gentle motions (0.3s ease-in-out transitions for fades, 0.5s elastic bounces for taps/swipes, floating animations at 1-2px sinusoidal drifts per second) to convey fluidity and reduce distractions.
